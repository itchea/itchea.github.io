  Hello,
This is my first post using jekyll, which is a static website generator (i.e. no databases or other complicated stuff).It certainly took long time to modify the htmls and csses, but i think it was worth it.

<div align="center"><img src="/public/helloworld.jpg"></img></div>
<p>
This website is hosted on github pages, which is a free hosting for personal and projects pages,and setup to work with my domain, which i got from godaddy.com for 1.99$ for the first year using a coupon code. 
<br><br>
In an ideal world i would have installed a more user friendly cms or blog, but unfortunately github pages don't allow mysql databases. that makes it quite impossible to have a fully functional website; however, jekyll dont use that. jekyll let you write your posts locally in any markdown language you like, and then transform them into full html pages.
<br><br>
I learned many new things in the process of getting this site up. The most valuable of them is using git cli, which turned out to be much better than downloading a master zip file. I also learned about dns zones and domain forwardnig.I also noticed that my html knowledge isn't that great, so i am trying to get better at html now (in fact i am writing this post in html now). 
<br><br>
Finally i thought of making a tutorial on making a website like mine, but there are already sufficient tutorials out there, so i am linking them. hopefully when i finish my layout, i will share my layout.
